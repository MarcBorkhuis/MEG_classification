# Domain Generalization Techniques for Cross-Subject MEG Classification

Cross-subject variability in magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals often leads to significant **domain shifts** between training and testing subjects, especially in low-data settings. Models can overfit to subject-specific patterns (e.g. individual sensor noise characteristics or idiosyncratic brain responses) that do not generalize, resulting in a large training–test performance gap. To address this, recent work in neuroimaging leverages **domain generalization** and **domain adaptation** methods that encourage the learning of subject-invariant features. Here we focus on three promising techniques – **CORAL**, **MMD**, and **GroupDRO** – and explain why they are well-suited for improving generalization in low-data, cross-subject MEG classification tasks. Each method is grounded in a distinct strategy (aligning covariance structure, aligning distributions, and robust optimization across groups) that aligns with the structure of neural signals and mitigates subject-specific overfitting.

## CORAL: Correlation Alignment

**Scientific motivation:** Correlation Alignment (CORAL) is a technique originally proposed for “frustratingly easy” domain adaptation. It targets differences in **second-order statistics** between domains by aligning covariance matrices of feature representations. The intuition is that a major component of subject-induced domain shift in neuroimaging lies in differing covariance structure of the data (e.g. spatial correlations between MEG sensor channels differ across subjects due to anatomy and sensor placement). By minimizing the discrepancy between the covariance of features from different subjects, CORAL encourages the model to learn a feature space with **similar second-order statistics across subjects**. This directly leverages the neural signal structure: covariance matrices are a natural way to represent brain connectivity or sensor correlations, so aligning them addresses a key aspect of how EEG/MEG signals vary between people. In practice, CORAL is implemented as an additional loss term that penalizes the Frobenius norm difference between source and target covariance matrices in a deep network. Notably, CORAL’s loss is differentiable and does not require adversarial training, making it simple and stable even with limited data.

**Reducing domain shift and overfitting:** By forcing feature covariance alignment, CORAL reduces subject-specific idiosyncrasies in the learned features. Essentially, it “normalizes” the feature space such that a model can’t rely on a particular covariance pattern unique to one subject. This acts as a form of regularization that directs the model to find signals that are consistently correlated across all training subjects, thus preventing overfitting to any single subject’s noise or peculiarities. In a cross-subject MEG context, this means the classifier focuses on brain activity patterns that are common and reproducible, rather than those tied to individual anatomy or session conditions. Aligning second-order statistics is particularly meaningful for neural time series because many subject differences (e.g. overall signal power, sensor covariance, noise covariance) manifest in the covariance structure. CORAL explicitly addresses this by matching those statistics, thereby **mitigating inter-subject distribution shift**. This helps close the training/test performance gap: models trained with CORAL see their feature distributions more homogeneous across subjects, so a new subject’s data is less “out-of-distribution” from the model’s perspective.

**Empirical evidence:** CORAL has shown clear benefits in neuroimaging classification tasks. For example, Wu et al. (2025) incorporated a correlation alignment step into a cross-subject EEG motor imagery decoder and achieved significantly higher accuracy on unseen subjects. By aligning the feature distributions between every pair of training subjects (“subdomains”), their model extracted **mutually invariant representations** that improved cross-subject generalization by \~8–9% in accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines. This confirms that enforcing covariance alignment can effectively reduce the harmful effects of subject variability. Similarly, Kim et al. (2025) found that applying **Deep CORAL** in an EEG emotion recognition framework improved subject-independent performance across the board. These studies underscore that CORAL’s emphasis on second-order statistics is well-aligned with neural signal data; it **improves robustness to inter-subject shifts** and thus is highly promising for low-data MEG settings where each subject provides limited samples. When data are scarce, the extra constraint from CORAL can prevent overfitting by focusing the model on cross-subject commonalities, thereby narrowing the training–test gap.

## Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)

**Scientific motivation:** Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a kernel-based metric that measures the difference between two probability distributions based on all their moments (i.e. it is sensitive to differences in the distributions’ means, variances, and higher-order statistics). In practice, MMD embeds data from two domains into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and computes the distance between their mean feature embeddings. If the distributions are identical, the MMD is zero; otherwise it quantifies the divergence. The key motivation for using MMD in domain generalization is to enforce **marginal alignment**: ensure that the overall feature distribution of the model is similar across different subjects (domains). This broad alignment goes beyond just the covariance (second-order) – it captures any distributional differences that can be expressed in the chosen kernel (often a Gaussian kernel for universal approximation). In the context of neural signals, subject differences may appear in many forms: baseline shifts in signal amplitude, variance, power spectrum differences, or other complex distributional shifts. MMD is well-suited to handle this because it does not assume a particular kind of shift (like only mean or covariance) but instead tries to make the **full feature distribution** similar across subjects. Intuitively, this encourages the learned representation to “forget” which subject a sample came from, since after alignment all subjects look statistically alike in feature space.

**Reducing domain shift and overfitting:** Incorporating an MMD-based loss into training compels the network to find features that minimize distribution discrepancies between subjects. By **penalizing differences in feature distributions**, the model is discouraged from exploiting subject-specific quirks (which would increase the divergence) and is pushed to find more general, task-relevant patterns present in all subjects. This directly addresses overfitting to the training subjects: any feature that overly characterizes a specific subject (and not others) will be tuned down by the model because it contributes to a larger MMD penalty. Especially in low-data regimes, MMD serves as a valuable constraint – when each subject provides limited examples, the model might otherwise pick up spurious patterns unique to those small samples; aligning distributions mitigates this risk by **sharing statistical strength across subjects**. Importantly, MMD alignment can accommodate the non-stationarity of EEG/MEG signals. Studies have noted that EEG signals are highly non-stationary and vary across sessions and individuals. MMD-based alignment has been used to counter this: for instance, aligning the marginal distributions of EEG features across sessions or subjects helps stabilize the model against such shifts. In summary, by making the **feature marginals indistinguishable across training subjects**, MMD helps ensure that a model trained on limited data from a few subjects will not be confounded by a new subject’s differing signal distribution, thus improving test generalization.

**Empirical evidence:** MMD is a well-established technique in transfer learning and has been successfully applied in neuroimaging domains. Early work by **Zheng et al. (2015)** on EEG emotion recognition introduced transfer component analysis (TCA), which uses an MMD criterion to align cross-subject feature distributions and showed improved subject-independent accuracy. Since then, numerous EEG studies have employed MMD for domain adaptation/generalization. For example, Li et al. (2018) computed a multi-kernel MMD in deep networks to reduce distribution differences between source and target subjects, yielding better cross-subject classification performance. Similarly, **Zhu et al. (2019)** applied MMD in a multi-source adaptation setting to match the marginal feature distributions of each source-target pair, which **reduced prediction divergence** between subject domains. These approaches consistently report that adding an MMD alignment loss helps models **learn invariant features** and boosts accuracy on unseen subjects compared to standard training. In fact, recent benchmarks in domain generalization have found that simple MMD-based methods can be as competitive as more complex algorithms. In an EEG context, Liu et al. (2021) adopted joint adaptation networks with MMD to avoid performance degradation across different subjects and sessions. Although most published applications are in EEG, the same principle applies to MEG: aligning the rich feature distribution of MEG data across subjects addresses the notorious between-subject variability. Thus, MMD offers a powerful and **statistically principled way to close the training–test gap** in cross-subject MEG classification, by ensuring the model’s learned feature space is not biased toward the limited training subjects’ distribution.

## GroupDRO: Group Distributionally Robust Optimization

**Scientific motivation:** Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GroupDRO) is a technique grounded in robust optimization theory that seeks to guarantee model performance across a set of predefined groups (in our case, subjects) rather than just on average. The core idea is to **minimize the worst-case training loss** over all groups, instead of the standard empirical risk minimization which minimizes average loss. In practice, this means the optimization process places greater emphasis on groups (subjects) where the model is performing poorly, up-weighting their loss until all groups are fairly optimized. The scientific motivation is to handle situations of **group shift**, where the data distribution differs among groups and a model might otherwise exploit easy groups at the expense of hard ones. In cross-subject neuroimaging, each subject can be seen as a group with its own data distribution; some subjects’ data might be inherently easier for the model (perhaps due to higher signal-to-noise ratio or more prototypical patterns), while others are harder. A vanilla training procedure tends to focus on the majority trend, which can lead to suboptimal performance on outlier subjects. GroupDRO explicitly counteracts this by asking: “How would the model perform on the worst-off subject?” and optimizing for that scenario. This approach aligns with the **robustness needs** of neuroimaging applications – we want models that perform reliably on any new subject, not just on average. Especially with small data, one subject with noisy data can be “overlooked” by a conventional training criterion, but GroupDRO will force the model to account for that subject’s distribution during training.

**Reducing domain shift and overfitting:** By treating each training subject as a distinct group and applying GroupDRO, the model is incentivized to learn features that work well **for all subjects, even those that are most difficult**. This substantially reduces the risk of overfitting to the idiosyncrasies of a few subjects. In fact, if the model tries to overly optimize for the easiest subject(s) (which could happen in low-data regimes where it’s tempted to simply memorize small datasets), GroupDRO’s objective will penalize that – because focusing on one subject would likely degrade performance on another, raising the worst-case loss. The result is a more balanced model that generalizes better across varied individuals. GroupDRO can be seen as a form of **regularization via reweighting**: it implicitly regularizes the model to not specialize too narrowly on any single domain. For cross-subject MEG, this means the classifier will not, for example, latch onto features that only certain subjects exhibit (like an artifact present only in one subject’s data), since doing so would hurt performance on other subjects and thus hurt the worst-case loss. Instead, the model is pushed to discover **robust features** that have predictive power across everyone – aligning with the idea of finding common neural patterns underlying the cognitive phenomena of interest. This mechanism addresses the training–test gap by simulating an adverse scenario: the model effectively prepares for the “hardest” possible new subject it might encounter. Consequently, when an actual new subject’s data is seen, the model is less surprised by distribution shifts, having been trained to handle adversity. GroupDRO thereby **mitigates inter-subject distributional shift** by ensuring the training process accounts for variability between subjects, rather than collapsing to an average that might only suit some subjects.

**Empirical evidence:** GroupDRO has demonstrated its value in maintaining robust performance across domains in several contexts. Originally introduced by Sagawa et al. (2020) for image and language tasks with spurious correlations, it delivered large improvements in worst-group accuracy without sacrificing overall accuracy. In the domain generalization library *DomainBed*, GroupDRO is included as a strong baseline method for robust learning across multiple source domains. Importantly, recent neuroimaging studies have started to adopt GroupDRO for subject-invariant learning. **Kim et al. (2025)** systematically evaluated GroupDRO on EEG emotion recognition and found it to significantly enhance subject-independent performance. In their experiments, a deep network (TSception) combined with GroupDRO achieved the highest accuracy in one of the emotional arousal classification tasks, outperforming other domain generalization methods. The authors noted that such domain generalization techniques (including GroupDRO) effectively **mitigate distributional shifts due to inter-subject variability**, leading to more robust EEG-based recognition. This finding is in line with the expectation that GroupDRO would prevent the model from overfitting to the specific characteristics of the training subjects, thereby improving generalization to new subjects. Although explicit studies on GroupDRO for MEG are still limited, the parallels between EEG and MEG (both suffer from subject-specific noise and signal differences) suggest similar benefits. By ensuring the model is optimized for worst-case subject performance during training, GroupDRO provides a safeguard against the training–test performance gap. In low-data scenarios, this is particularly advantageous: even if one subject’s training data is very limited or noisy, GroupDRO will make sure the model still pays attention to it, thus **bolstering the model’s resilience** when facing an entirely new subject in testing.

**Conclusion:** In summary, **CORAL, MMD, and GroupDRO each address cross-subject generalization in complementary ways**. CORAL aligns the **second-order statistics** of features, directly leveraging the covariance structure of neural signals to find common ground between subjects. MMD enforces **marginal distribution alignment** in feature space, capturing a broad range of distributional differences and statistically tying subjects’ data together. GroupDRO focuses on **robust optimization across subject groups**, ensuring no single subject dominates training at the expense of others. All three methods have been shown to reduce subject-specific overfitting and improve performance on unseen subjects in EEG/MEG contexts. By incorporating these techniques, one can substantially narrow the training/test performance gap characteristic of low-data cross-subject MEG classification. In practice, they encourage models to learn the underlying neural patterns that truly generalize – precisely the goal in brain signal classification research where domain shifts are a formidable challenge.
